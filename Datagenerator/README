This is a simple example of a more complex scene that includes
some elements used in an actual production setting.

The model is a hierarchical subdivision surface that uses 
a Mari texture atlas to add displacement, color and roughness.

Note that the output of the PxrTextureAtlas pattern is used to
feed into the diffuseColor and the roughness of the Disney BXDF.

Interestingly, the roughness texture is color texure, and the
roughness parameter for the BXDF wants a float. This is where
we use the "alphaindex" parameter to specify that we want to
lookup channel 0 as the "alpha". In this case we are using the
name "alpha" to represent a single float result.  We then pass 
that "alpha" (single float) result to the BXDF.

For faster results, reduce the maxsamples parameter on the Hider
parameter list. For less noisy results increase the maxsamples
parameter. Ideally with adaptive sampling, the minsamples
parameter is the square root of the maxsamples parameter.
