each time estimate the mesh, the depth may be not correct.
however, We will track these features. 
In the next frame, we can get its depth again. and  compare the error, 

to determine which one is better?
1.but it maybe a false tracking 


mesh refine 
compare the face error to refine mesh

how to refine?
each vertex bind with multiple faces


There are many lists
how to find the relation 
1.mcorner  x
2.addvertex x-a
3.remove by tracking x-b
