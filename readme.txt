找出face 的相鄰關係

1.belong to which face,find its boundary. (however, it is not a robust approach)
2.it variation is  smooth from a domain center move to another center and without any intersection with any domain area. 
  and will not cross any face link
  a. has boundary (a vertex on the boundary )
  b. has intersection (skip) 

then, for each face group, we can find there will be a vertex
